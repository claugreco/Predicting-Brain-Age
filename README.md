Predicting Brain Age with Convolutional Neural Networks

The human brain changes across the adult lifespan, it is possible to identify the signs of aging in a brain MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) images and even to determine a brain age. The difference between brain age and chronological age can reveal conditions such as dementia, schizophrenia, diabetes, disorders that make the brain appear older. The goal of this project is to accurately predict the chronological brain age based on MRI data. We accomplished this by using a predictive modelling approach based on deep learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN), and applied to neuroimaging data.
